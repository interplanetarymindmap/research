*Welcome to [Department of Research](http://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/1/20/18/61/20160119/ob_722e22_bureau-bordel.jpg) at Interplanetary Mind Map.* 

*Sorry for the mess. We will try our best to maintain the repository as neat and clean as possible, but keep in mind that why we are here is to **understand how to organize information**, so maybe we all have to deal with a little of chaos and randomness until we can reach to some conclusions. Thank you for your understanding. Any suggestion, comment or hyperlink will be much appreciated. Love :-)*

[The History of Schematics in Data Visualization](https://sheilapontis.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/english1.pdf). *Sheila Pontis, October 2007.*

**Visual language**, irrespective of its characteristics, **transmits a two-dimensional message**. When the eye contemplates an image, it wanders freely over the optical surface of the image. And even in cases where the eye is not free, such as a set of graphic instructions, it thinks it is and wanders as it will; it is not disciplined by a mechanism of cultural obligation (learning to read) which forces the eye to move along a line. […] In other words, visual language, as opposed to textual language, is structured on the base of images and therefore, the reader can link and relate ideas and concepts. Thus, **this type of reading is similar to a way of thinking**. Thought can be defined as a succession of images with no apparent pre­established order. In this same way, schematic language is constructed. Although it is structured, it is not a rigid language permitting only one type of reading.

[…]

Currently, **the structure of the organization and visualization of information is changing very quickly**, becoming more complex every day. […] The application of graphic data representation methods to various information problems is constantly expanding, and we must remember that the main purpose of all graphic constructions is **communication**.

——— *additional ideas*

- Language is used to represent or construct reality.
- <a id="graphic-method">*Graphic method*</a> is the organization and representation of information with visual language.

——— *insights*

- We are using ways to organize information visually as reference to understand the relationships between different pieces of information when building structures of meaning. It is easy to get confused between the structure of the visualization (or render as we are referring now) and the structure of the data base when we are designing them, and it is important that we approach each of them as independent topics.

## Fragments from Wikipedia

### [Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language)

Human language has the **properties of productivity and displacement**, and **relies entirely on social convention and learning**.

[...]

When described as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: **signs**, **meanings**, and **a code connecting signs with their meanings**. The study of […] how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [*semiotics*](#semiotics).

[...]

**Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content**. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by **social convention**. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

**All languages contain the semantic structure of predication: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action**. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign truth values to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "**[x [is y]]**" or "**[x [does y]]**". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the **context** in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [*pragmatics*](#pragmatics).

[...]

All languages **change** as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. 

——— *additional ideas*

- Language is a tool for communication.
- Language is a social fact. (extracted from [*social semiotics*](#social-semiotics))

### [Human communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_communication) (also anthroposemiotics)

Human communication, or anthroposemiotics, is the field dedicated to understanding how humans communicate. Human communication is grounded in cooperative and shared intentions.

[...]

The current study of human communication can be branched off into two major categories; **rhetorical and relational**. The focus of rhetorical communication is primarily on the study of influence; the art of rhetorical communication is based on the idea of **persuasion**. The relational approach examines communication from a **transactional** perspective; two or more people interact to reach an agreed perspective.

[...]

Aristotle stated that effective rhetoric is based on argumentation. [...] **[*rhetoric*](#rhetoric) involves a dominant party and a submissive party** or a party that succumbs to that of the most dominant party. While the rhetorical approach stems from Western societies, the relational approach stems from Eastern societies. Eastern societies hold higher standards for cooperation, which makes sense as to why they would sway more toward a relational approach for that matter. "**Maintaining valued relationships is generally seen as more important than exerting influence and control over others**".

## Glossary 

###### <a id="semiotics">[Semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics)</a>

Semiotics is the study of [*meaning-making*](#meaning-making), the study of sign process ([*semiosis*](#semiosis)) and **meaningful communication**.

###### <a id="social-semiotics">[Social semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_semiotics)</a> (also social semantics)

[...] tries to explain meaning-making as a social practice. [...] "codes" of language and communication are formed by social processes. [...] meanings and semiotic systems are shaped by relations of power, and that as power shifts in society, our languages and other systems of socially accepted meanings can and do change. [...] Social semiotics is thus **the study of the social dimensions of meaning**, and of **the power of human processes of signification and interpretation** (known as [*semiosis*](#semiosis)) **in shaping individuals and societies**.

###### <a id="meaning-making">[Meaning-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning-making)</a>

In psychology, meaning-making is the process of how people construe, understand, or make sense of life events, relationships, and the self.

###### <a id="semiosis">[Semiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis)</a>

Semiosis is any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves signs, including the **production of meaning**. Briefly – **semiosis is sign process**.

###### <a id="semantics">[Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics)</a>

Semantics is the **linguistic and philosophical study of meaning**, in language, programming languages, formal logics, and semiotics. It is concerned with the relationship between signifiers—like words, phrases, signs, and symbols—and what they stand for, their denotation.

###### <a id="pragmatics">[Pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics)</a>

Pragmatics is a subfield of linguistics and semiotics that **studies the ways in which context contributes to meaning**. […] pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent ambiguity, since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance.

###### <a id="rhetoric">[Rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric)</a>

The **relationship between rhetoric and knowledge** is an old and interesting philosophical problem, partly because of our different assumptions on the nature of knowledge. But it is fairly clear that **while knowledge is primarily concerned with what is commonly known as "truth", rhetoric is primarily concerned with statements and their effects on the audience**. The word "rhetoric" may also refer to "empty speak", which reflects an indifference to truth, and in this sense rhetoric is adversarial to knowledge.
