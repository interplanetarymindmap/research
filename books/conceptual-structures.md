The broad coverage in this book combines material from philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and artificial intelligence. As a unifying force, the book focuses on conceptual graphs - networks of concepts and conceptual relations developed over the past twenty years. Important topics include: **philosophical issues of knowledge and meaning**; **cognitive psychology in relation to linguistics** and artificial intelligence; **conceptual graphs as a knowledge representation language**; applications for formal logic, plausible reasoning, heuristics, and computation; natural language parsing, generation, and pragmatics; **knowledge-based systems**, conceptual analysis, and **database design** and query; limits of conceptualization and unsolved problems. To accommodate readers from various disciplines, this book is designed to be read at different levels.
