For almost a century, educational theory and practice have been influenced by the view of behavioural psychologists that learning is synonymous with behaviour change. In this book, the authors argue for the practical importance of an alternate view, that **learning is synonymous with a change in the meaning of experience**. They develop their **theory of the conceptual nature of knowledge** and describe classroom-tested strategies for helping students to construct new and more powerful meanings and to integrate thinking, feeling, and acting. In their research, they have found consistently that standard educational practices that do not lead learners to grasp the meaning of tasks usually fail to give them confidence in their abilities. **It is necessary to understand why and how new information is related to what one already knows.** All those concerned with the improvement of education will find something of interest in Learning How to Learn.
