Organized by topics.

## Tools

Marshall McLuhan famously said **"We shape our tools. And then our tools shape us."** McLuhan was referring to the fact that our social practices co-evolve with our use of new tools and the refinements we make to existing tools. [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool)

**"You want your tools to be used in ways that you didn't anticipate."** Joi Ito [7:27](https://youtu.be/gm6YeeYOJ38?t=447)

## How

"So I think the good news is that even though the world is extremely complex, what you need to do is very simple. I think it's about stopping this notion that you need to plan everything, you need to stock everything, and you need to be so prepared, and focus on being connected, always learning, fully aware, and super present." Joi Ito, [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/joi_ito_want_to_innovate_become_a_now_ist/) (11:33)

## Meaning

**“We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning.”** Jean Baudrillard, Simulacra and Simulation.

## <a id="language">[Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language)</a>

Human language has the **properties of productivity and displacement**, and **relies entirely on social convention and learning**.

[...]

When described as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: **signs**, **meanings**, and **a code connecting signs with their meanings**. The study of […] how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [*semiotics*](#semiotics).

[...]

**Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content**. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by **social convention**. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

**All languages contain the semantic structure of predication: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action**. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign truth values to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "**[x [is y]]**" or "**[x [does y]]**". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the **context** in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [*pragmatics*](#pragmatics).

[...]

All languages **change** as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community.

## <a id="human-communication">[Human communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_communication)</a>

Human communication, or anthroposemiotics, is the field dedicated to understanding how humans communicate. Human communication is grounded in cooperative and shared intentions.

[...]

The current study of human communication can be branched off into two major categories; **rhetorical and relational**. The focus of rhetorical communication is primarily on the study of influence; the art of rhetorical communication is based on the idea of **persuasion**. The relational approach examines communication from a **transactional** perspective; two or more people interact to reach an agreed perspective.

[...]

Aristotle stated that effective rhetoric is based on argumentation. [...] **[*rhetoric*](#rhetoric) involves a dominant party and a submissive party** or a party that succumbs to that of the most dominant party. While the rhetorical approach stems from Western societies, the relational approach stems from Eastern societies. Eastern societies hold higher standards for cooperation, which makes sense as to why they would sway more toward a relational approach for that matter. "**Maintaining valued relationships is generally seen as more important than exerting influence and control over others**".

###### <a id="semiotics">[Semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics)</a>

Semiotics is the study of [*meaning-making*](#meaning-making), the study of sign process ([*semiosis*](#semiosis)) and **meaningful communication**.

###### <a id="social-semiotics">[Social semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_semiotics)</a> (also social semantics)

[...] tries to explain meaning-making as a social practice. [...] "codes" of language and communication are formed by social processes. [...] meanings and semiotic systems are shaped by relations of power, and that as power shifts in society, our languages and other systems of socially accepted meanings can and do change. [...] Social semiotics is thus **the study of the social dimensions of meaning**, and of **the power of human processes of signification and interpretation** (known as [*semiosis*](#semiosis)) **in shaping individuals and societies**.

###### <a id="meaning-making">[Meaning-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning-making)</a>

In psychology, meaning-making is the process of how people construe, understand, or make sense of life events, relationships, and the self.

###### <a id="semiosis">[Semiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis)</a>

Semiosis is any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves signs, including the **production of meaning**. Briefly – **semiosis is sign process**.

###### <a id="semantics">[Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics)</a>

Semantics is the **linguistic and philosophical study of meaning**, in language, programming languages, formal logics, and semiotics. It is concerned with the relationship between signifiers—like words, phrases, signs, and symbols—and what they stand for, their denotation.

###### <a id="pragmatics">[Pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics)</a>

Pragmatics is a subfield of linguistics and semiotics that **studies the ways in which context contributes to meaning**. […] pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent ambiguity, since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance.

###### <a id="rhetoric">[Rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric)</a>

The **relationship between rhetoric and knowledge** is an old and interesting philosophical problem, partly because of our different assumptions on the nature of knowledge. But it is fairly clear that **while knowledge is primarily concerned with what is commonly known as "truth", rhetoric is primarily concerned with statements and their effects on the audience**. The word "rhetoric" may also refer to "empty speak", which reflects an indifference to truth, and in this sense rhetoric is adversarial to knowledge.
