[The History of Schematics in Data Visualization](https://sheilapontis.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/english1.pdf), Sheila Pontis, October 2007.

"**Visual language**, irrespective of its characteristics, **transmits a two-dimensional message**. When the eye contemplates an image, it wanders freely over the optical surface of the image. And even in cases where the eye is not free, such as a set of graphic instructions, it thinks it is and wanders as it will; it is not disciplined by a mechanism of cultural obligation (learning to read) which forces the eye to move along a line. […] In other words, visual language, as opposed to textual language, is structured on the base of images and therefore, the reader can link and relate ideas and concepts. Thus, **this type of reading is similar to a way of thinking**. Thought can be defined as a succession of images with no apparent pre­established order. In this same way, schematic language is constructed. Although it is structured, it is not a rigid language permitting only one type of reading.

[…]

Currently, **the structure of the organization and visualization of information is changing very quickly**, becoming more complex every day. […] The application of graphic data representation methods to various information problems is constantly expanding, and we must remember that the main purpose of all graphic constructions is **communication**."

——— *additional ideas*

- Language is used to represent or construct reality.
- <a id="graphic-method">*Graphic method*</a> is the organization and representation of information with visual language.

——— *insights*

- We are using ways to organize information visually as reference to understand the relationships between different pieces of information when building structures of meaning. It is easy to get confused between the structure of the visualization (or render as we are referring now) and the structure of the data base when we are designing them, and it is important that we approach each of them as independent topics.
