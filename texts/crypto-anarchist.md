"Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups **to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner**."

- relationship with information and anonymity

"**Reputations will be of central importance**, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today."

- reputation

"The technology for this revolution has existed in theory for the past decade. [...] But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable."

- Same story with www, aka the internet? Maybe now technology is ready to apply some principles envisioned at beginning, plus society is also more mature.

"Combined with emerging **information markets**, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures.

- relationship with information and markets (value of information)
