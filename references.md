That is, he sees limitations in the utility of an encyclopedia produced by only partially interested third parties as a form of communication.**

## <a id="history-of-schematics">The History of Schematics in Data Visualization</a>

"**Visual language**, irrespective of its characteristics, **transmits a two-dimensional message**. When the eye contemplates an image, it wanders freely over the optical surface of the image. And even in cases where the eye is not free, such as a set of graphic instructions, it thinks it is and wanders as it will; it is not disciplined by a mechanism of cultural obligation (learning to read) which forces the eye to move along a line. […] In other words, visual language, as opposed to textual language, is structured on the base of images and therefore, the reader can link and relate ideas and concepts. Thus, **this type of reading is similar to a way of thinking**. Thought can be defined as a succession of images with no apparent pre­established order. In this same way, schematic language is constructed. Although it is structured, it is not a rigid language permitting only one type of reading.

[…]

Currently, **the structure of the organization and visualization of information is changing very quickly**, becoming more complex every day. […] The application of graphic data representation methods to various information problems is constantly expanding, and we must remember that the main purpose of all graphic constructions is **communication**."

——— *additional ideas*

- Language is used to represent or construct reality.
- <a id="graphic-method">*Graphic method*</a> is the organization and representation of information with visual language.

——— *insights*

- We are using ways to organize information visually as reference to understand the relationships between different pieces of information when building structures of meaning. It is easy to get confused between the structure of the visualization (or render as we are referring now) and the structure of the data base when we are designing them, and it is important that we approach each of them as independent topics.

## <a id="crypto-anarchist">The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto</a>

"Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups **to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner**."

- relationship with information and anonymity

"**Reputations will be of central importance**, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today."

- reputation

"The technology for this revolution has existed in theory for the past decade. [...] But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable."

- Same story with www, aka the internet? Maybe now technology is ready to apply some principles envisioned at beginning, plus society is also more mature.

"Combined with emerging **information markets**, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures.

- relationship with information and markets (value of information)

## <a id="the-information">The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood, by James Gleick.</a>

- Information as the "fundamental core of things".
- Gleick describes the bit as "the irreducible quantum of information”. 
- "Binary yes or no choices are at the root of things". 
- Each new bit of information is a **surprise** — if you knew what a particular message contained, there would not be information in it. 
- We can see now that information is what our world runs on.
- "The information circle becomes the unit of life," says Werner Loewenstein after thirty years spent studying intercellular communication. He reminds us that information means something deeper now: "It connotes a cosmic principle of organization and order, and it provides an exact measure of that." The gene has its cultural analog, too: the meme. In cultural evolution, **a meme is a replicator and propagator—an idea, a fashion, a chain letter, or a conspiracy theory**. On a bad day, a meme is a virus.
- What is the link between energy and information?

## <a id="who-owns">Who Owns the Future?</a>

In his book Who Owns the Future? (2013), Lanier posits that the middle class is increasingly disenfranchised from online economies. **By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost**. Lanier calls these firms “Siren Servers,” alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. For example, he points to Google’s translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. In another example, Lanier points out that in 1988, Kodak employed 140,000 people when it led the digital imaging industry. By 2012, Kodak had filed for bankruptcy due to free photo-sharing sites such as Instagram which employed only 13 people at the time. As a solution to these problems, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson’s Project Xanadu. **He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.**

## <a id="learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</a>

For almost a century, educational theory and practice have been influenced by the view of behavioural psychologists that learning is synonymous with behaviour change. In this book, the authors argue for the practical importance of an alternate view, that **learning is synonymous with a change in the meaning of experience**. They develop their **theory of the conceptual nature of knowledge** and describe classroom-tested strategies for helping students to construct new and more powerful meanings and to integrate thinking, feeling, and acting. In their research, they have found consistently that standard educational practices that do not lead learners to grasp the meaning of tasks usually fail to give them confidence in their abilities. **It is necessary to understand why and how new information is related to what one already knows.** All those concerned with the improvement of education will find something of interest in Learning How to Learn.

## <a id="knowledge-representation">Knowledge Representation: Logical, Philosophical, and Computational Foundations</a>

John Sowa integrates logic, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science into this study of knowledge and its various models and implementations. **His definitive new book shows how techniques of artificial intelligence, database design, and object-oriented programming help make knowledge explicit in a form that computer systems can use.** The first three chapters are devoted to logic, ontology, and computable models of reality. Remaining chapters apply theories to the analysis of problems stated in ordinary language, and their translation to computable form. The text is self-contained, with each new idea defined when first mentioned; all formalism is developed in the body of the text or summarized in an appendix. Knowledge Representation is appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, as well as philosophy and linguistics students with some background in artificial intelligence or programming.

***about the book**: “This book is a general textbook of knowledge-base analysis and design, intended for anyone whose job is to analyze knowledge about the real world and map it to a computable form”*.

## <a id="conceptual-structures">Conceptual structures: Information processing in mind and machine</a>

The broad coverage in this book combines material from philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and artificial intelligence. As a unifying force, the book focuses on conceptual graphs - networks of concepts and conceptual relations developed over the past twenty years. Important topics include: **philosophical issues of knowledge and meaning**; **cognitive psychology in relation to linguistics** and artificial intelligence; **conceptual graphs as a knowledge representation language**; applications for formal logic, plausible reasoning, heuristics, and computation; natural language parsing, generation, and pragmatics; **knowledge-based systems**, conceptual analysis, and **database design** and query; limits of conceptualization and unsolved problems. To accommodate readers from various disciplines, this book is designed to be read at different levels.

## <a id="knowledge-arena">The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: Reflection in Action</a>

The concept map is becoming a ubiquitous tool in education. In recent years there has been a growing interest in “diagramming” or “mapping” ideas to be learned. The approach has been championed by study skills proponents such as Buzan (1993). **Maps of concepts and relationships have been used by many researchers and practitioners to help diagnose misunderstanding, improve study methods and glimpse how learners come to know.** In other areas, the representation of knowledge in formalisms such as the Net greatly assisted the development of intelligent tutoring systems (e.g., Sowa, 1983). In order to better understand the claims made for its efficacy, reference to how concept maps have been used and defined will lead to a plausible explanation of the process of “off–loading” of concepts during learning or study (McAleese, 1994, 1998). In order to demonstrate the widespread application of supporting learn ers with external “learning spaces” (c.f. ISLEs/ and REALs—Grabinger et al., 1998; Grabinger & Dunlap, 1995; MacFarlane, 1993), consideration will be given in this paper to techniques that formally represent knowledge in Concept–Relationship–Concept “instances” (Fisher et al., 1990). Other techniques such as **reflection journals** draw on the same process but are not considered in detail here. The importance of self regulation (Zimmerman, 1990) and self-confrontation (McAleese, 1985) is highlighted in this framework. **The map as a mirror or an assistant to learners** is well documented (e.g., Vizcarro & Leon, 1998); the question of an external representation of thinking, in the form of a map determining what can be learned as well as what might be learned, is not yet fully known.

## <a id="the-basis-of-the-universe">The basis of the universe may not be energy or matter but information: In this radical view, the universe is a giant supercomputer processing particles as bits</a>

Science writer James Gleick, author of The Information, contends that it wasn’t Shannon, but early 19th century mathematician Charles Babbage, who first called information the central component of all and everything. Babbage is credited for first conceptualizing the computer, way before anyone had the ability to even build one.

**If the nature of reality is in fact reducible to information itself, that implies a conscious mind on the receiving end, to interpret and comprehend it.** Wheeler himself believed in a participatory universe, where consciousness holds a central role.
