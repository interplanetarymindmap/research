## <a id="history-of-schematics">The History of Schematics in Data Visualization</a>

"**Visual language**, irrespective of its characteristics, **transmits a two-dimensional message**. When the eye contemplates an image, it wanders freely over the optical surface of the image. And even in cases where the eye is not free, such as a set of graphic instructions, it thinks it is and wanders as it will; it is not disciplined by a mechanism of cultural obligation (learning to read) which forces the eye to move along a line. […] In other words, visual language, as opposed to textual language, is structured on the base of images and therefore, the reader can link and relate ideas and concepts. Thus, **this type of reading is similar to a way of thinking**. Thought can be defined as a succession of images with no apparent pre­established order. In this same way, schematic language is constructed. Although it is structured, it is not a rigid language permitting only one type of reading.

[…]

Currently, **the structure of the organization and visualization of information is changing very quickly**, becoming more complex every day. […] The application of graphic data representation methods to various information problems is constantly expanding, and we must remember that the main purpose of all graphic constructions is **communication**."

——— *additional ideas*

- Language is used to represent or construct reality.
- <a id="graphic-method">*Graphic method*</a> is the organization and representation of information with visual language.

——— *insights*

- We are using ways to organize information visually as reference to understand the relationships between different pieces of information when building structures of meaning. It is easy to get confused between the structure of the visualization (or render as we are referring now) and the structure of the data base when we are designing them, and it is important that we approach each of them as independent topics.

## <a id="crypto-anarchist">The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto</a>

"Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups **to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner**."

- relationship with information and anonymity

"**Reputations will be of central importance**, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today."

- reputation

"The technology for this revolution has existed in theory for the past decade. [...] But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable."

- Same story with www, aka the internet? Maybe now technology is ready to apply some principles envisioned at beginning, plus society is also more mature.

"Combined with emerging **information markets**, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures.

- relationship with information and markets (value of information)




## <a id="knowledge-arena">The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: Reflection in Action</a>

The concept map is becoming a ubiquitous tool in education. In recent years there has been a growing interest in “diagramming” or “mapping” ideas to be learned. The approach has been championed by study skills proponents such as Buzan (1993). **Maps of concepts and relationships have been used by many researchers and practitioners to help diagnose misunderstanding, improve study methods and glimpse how learners come to know.** In other areas, the representation of knowledge in formalisms such as the Net greatly assisted the development of intelligent tutoring systems (e.g., Sowa, 1983). In order to better understand the claims made for its efficacy, reference to how concept maps have been used and defined will lead to a plausible explanation of the process of “off–loading” of concepts during learning or study (McAleese, 1994, 1998). In order to demonstrate the widespread application of supporting learn ers with external “learning spaces” (c.f. ISLEs/ and REALs—Grabinger et al., 1998; Grabinger & Dunlap, 1995; MacFarlane, 1993), consideration will be given in this paper to techniques that formally represent knowledge in Concept–Relationship–Concept “instances” (Fisher et al., 1990). Other techniques such as **reflection journals** draw on the same process but are not considered in detail here. The importance of self regulation (Zimmerman, 1990) and self-confrontation (McAleese, 1985) is highlighted in this framework. **The map as a mirror or an assistant to learners** is well documented (e.g., Vizcarro & Leon, 1998); the question of an external representation of thinking, in the form of a map determining what can be learned as well as what might be learned, is not yet fully known.

## <a id="the-basis-of-the-universe">The basis of the universe may not be energy or matter but information: In this radical view, the universe is a giant supercomputer processing particles as bits</a>

Science writer James Gleick, author of The Information, contends that it wasn’t Shannon, but early 19th century mathematician Charles Babbage, who first called information the central component of all and everything. Babbage is credited for first conceptualizing the computer, way before anyone had the ability to even build one.

**If the nature of reality is in fact reducible to information itself, that implies a conscious mind on the receiving end, to interpret and comprehend it.** Wheeler himself believed in a participatory universe, where consciousness holds a central role.
